* Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Deep Neural Networks
This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset that includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. We implemented a deep neural network (DNN) model and a baseline one-hidden-layer neural network to compare their performance in this classification task. The DNN model, with 16 neurons in its hidden layer and ReLU activation, achieved higher accuracy (0.9976), precision (0.9877), recall (0.9842), and F1 score (0.9859) compared to the baseline model. Despite the baseline model's simplicity and ease of training, it performed slightly worse in all metrics. Our findings highlight the superior capability of the DNN model in accurately detecting fraudulent transactions, though it requires more computational resources and data for optimal performance. The predictive model developed can be deployed in the financial sector for real-time fraud detection, enhancing security and reducing losses from unauthorized transactions.
